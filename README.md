### **_Project Description_**
**PawPals Health Hub** is a mobile application designed to empower pet owners with a comprehensive tool for tracking and managing their pet's health. With a user-friendly interface, PawPals Health Hub allows individuals to create profiles for their beloved pets, ensuring all vital health information is readily accessible at their fingertips.

### **_Key Features_**

**Diet & Weight Management:** Log your pet's food type, amount, and feeding frequency for a well-maintained diet and track their weight over time.

**Vet Visits:** Log vet visits, categorizing each visit as either sick or healthy. Keep track of medical treatments, procedures, and recommendations in the notes section.

**Vaccine Tracking:** Easily record and monitor your pet's vaccinations, including details like vaccine types, administration dates, and upcoming boosters. 

**Medication Tracking:** Easily recall medications your pet has taken along with dose, frequency, and duration. 

**Health Incidents:** Record dated health incidents such as injuries, new diagnoses, or symptoms, ensuring a thorough health history.

**PawPals Health Hub** aims to simplify the management of your pet's well-being, providing a centralized platform to track their health journey and facilitate effective communication with veterinarians.
